# Anko Constraint Layout
## Purpose of library

This library adds missing support for Constraint Layout in Anko library.

## Usage

### IDs

Constraint Layout heavily depends on ids of its child views. 
For that reason, each child has to have defined an unique id.
We can predefine static ids for each view in `ids.xml` file to be generated by aapt and reference
them in code by `R.id.name_of_view_id`. This can be burdensome to do for every view we add.

This library automatically generates a **dynamic** unique id for each view that is added to the 
Constraint Layout and does not have a specified id.
This ensures positioning of views works correctly, but these ids do NOT get retained across 
configuration changes. That means any view that save its state into a bundle to be persisted across
configuration change will NOT be able to restore its state.
For numerous views such as `TextView`, `Button`, `ImageView`, etc. it is not a big deal because these
views usually don't modify their state based on user input. For other views such as `EditText`, 
`CheckBox`, `RadiButton`, `SeekBar`, etc. it is strongly advised to specify a static id so that
Android framework can restore the view's state automatically.

If you want to disable this functionality, you may toggle a generateIds to false.
```kotlin
val view = context.constraintLayout {

    generateIds = false
    // added views here won't have generated ids
                 
    generateIds = true
    // added views here will once again have generated ids, unless id has been assigned during its creation
}
```

Also, do NOT change ids of views after they have been added to the ConstraintLayout. ConstrainLayout
internally saves references to its views via view's id when it has been added. Changing view's id
and referencing it through its new id will not work and the view will most likely not even get displayed.

## Sample

Sample app with can be found in `app` module.

## Dependencies

Add this dependency to your project:
```groovy
implementation 'cz.ackee:anko-constraint-layout:0.4.1'
```

This library is still in development and your implementation might break when minor version gets bumped up. For now, backwards non-compatible changes happens about once every week.
